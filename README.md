# FloraForecast
## Predicting Flower type with ML
### It's a basic machine learning powered web application in Python using the streamlit library in less than 50 lines of code.

## How it Develops ?
*FloraForecast is a web app that built using framework and core concept of Python.*

* Python - To code and conduct the flow of model.
* Machine Learning -
     1. To preprocess the dataset.
     2. To transform the data.
     3. To build the model.
     4. To predict the flower type i.e., predictions.
* Streamlit - To design and implement the user interface (UI) of the web application with a focus on enhancing interactivity.

1. User input parameters from basic Iris Dataset.
2. Select the lengths and widths from sidebar slider.
3. Using Random_Forest_Classifier ML Model.
4. It will predict the Flower type.
